        <p class="text-lg">
            Throughout my professional career, I have worked in <strong>software development</strong> for vision systems in industrial and aerospace environments. 
            One of the most prominent projects I was involved in was the implementation of a <strong>vision system for a flexible riveting machine</strong>, 
            as well as the development of its <strong>user interface</strong>.
        </p>
    
        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">🚀 Software development in computer vision</h3>
        <p class="text-lg mt-2">
            In this project, I developed software using technologies such as <strong>C, C++, ROS, OpenCV, PCL, and Qt</strong>, 
            focusing on image processing, hardware control, and the development of interactive interfaces.
        </p>
    
        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">✈️ Aerospace manufacturing process automation</h3>
        <p class="text-lg mt-2">
            In the aerospace industry, one of the key processes in aircraft manufacturing is <strong>drilling components</strong>. 
            Currently, this process is carried out in two ways: manually by an operator or with a specific machine. 
            However, these traditional machines lack <strong>flexibility</strong>, as they are designed for specific tasks and cannot adapt to different aircraft parts.
        </p>
    
        <p class="text-lg mt-2">
            My work was part of a larger project aimed at <strong>solving this lack of flexibility</strong> in aerospace manufacturing automation. 
            A <strong>smart robot</strong> was developed to autonomously drill different aircraft parts, 
            using key information such as <strong>previously drilled holes, drilling maps, and vision systems</strong>. 
            This was a technical challenge that required the use of advanced computer vision and robotic control techniques.
        </p>
    
        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">🎯 Project goal</h3>
        <p class="text-lg mt-2">
            One of the central aspects of the project was the <strong>analysis and study of a Gocator 2340 laser device</strong>, 
            aimed at improving the precision of detection and processing of drilling points on aerospace structures.
        </p>
    
        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">🙏 Technological contribution to the Hermandad de la Macarena</h3>
        <p class="text-lg mt-2">
            Completely <strong>altruistically</strong>, I have applied my technological knowledge to develop 
            applications that allow <strong>geolocating, monitoring, and improving the organization</strong> of the Hermandad de la Macarena brotherhood. 
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg mt-2">
            These developments have helped optimize event and route management, providing real-time information 
            to facilitate the coordination of the brotherhood with no financial interest, solely with the goal of adding value to the community.
