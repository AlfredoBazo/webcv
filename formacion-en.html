        <p class="text-lg mt-6">📍 My academic journey began at Colegio Concertado Las Artes (Seville), where I studied from preschool to secondary school. Later, I completed my Baccalaureate at IES Valle Inclán, laying the foundation for my passion for technology and engineering.</p>

                    🚀 <strong>I decided to specialize in the technological field</strong> and studied <strong>Telecommunications Engineering</strong> at the <strong>University of Seville</strong>, following the old curriculum. This education provided me with a solid technical foundation in networks, communication systems, and software development.

                <p class="text-lg mt-4">
                    🤖 For <strong>two years</strong>, I worked as a developer in the <strong>Robotics, Vision, and Control Group</strong>, participating in a <strong>project with Airbus and CATEC</strong> (Advanced Center for Aerospace Technologies). This project became my <strong>final project</strong>, earning a <span class="text-[#ffcc00]">🏆 Honors Degree</span>.

                🌍 Besides my university education, I have worked on improving my language skills. I obtained the <strong>C1 English certification from the University of Cambridge 🇬🇧</strong> and complemented my learning with <strong>four summers in England</strong>, perfecting my skills in an immersive environment. Professionally, I have been using <strong>English since 2016</strong> in my day-to-day work, participating in international projects with multicultural teams. Since <strong>June 2021</strong>, I have been working at a <strong>U.S. company 🇺🇸</strong>, where English is my main language for <strong>emails, chats, meetings, and technical documentation</strong>. I also collaborate with colleagues from <strong>the U.S. 🇺🇸 and various other nationalities</strong>, which has allowed me to develop fluent and effective communication in a global environment.
