    <p class="text-lg">
        Technology has always been one of my greatest passions. My curiosity to understand how systems work and my desire to optimize processes have led me to specialize in <strong>software quality and test automation</strong>. I enjoy exploring new tools, developing innovative solutions, and applying advanced methodologies to improve efficiency and security in technological environments.

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">🙏 Applying technology in the holy week of Seville</h3>
    <p class="text-lg mt-2">
        Beyond my professional field, I have had the opportunity to <strong>apply my technological knowledge</strong> in a very special environment: the <strong>Holy Week of Seville</strong>. Completely <strong>altruistically</strong>, I have developed solutions for the <strong>Macarena Brotherhood</strong>, creating applications for <strong>geolocation, monitoring, and route optimization</strong>.

        These tools have improved the management of the brotherhood, providing real-time information to facilitate organization and coordination during Holy Week. Being able to contribute my experience in such a meaningful field has been one of the most rewarding experiences of my career.

        In addition to my work in companies and altruistic collaborations, I dedicate part of my time to <strong>developing personal projects</strong>. Some of them are in the experimental phase and haven't been revealed yet, but they represent an opportunity to <strong>explore new technologies, solve innovative problems, and continue learning</strong>. I am motivated by the possibility of creating technological solutions with real impact, whether in the professional field or society.
